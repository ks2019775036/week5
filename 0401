vi Commands

vi commands are used in "screen "mod (the default), where
you use the commands to move around the screen and to per-
form operations on the text.

Most vi commands follow a general pattern:
	[command][number]textobject
or the equivalent form:
	[number][command]textobject

Movement Commands

vi movement commands distinguish between two kinds of
"words." The lowercase commands define a word as a contig-
uous sequence of underscores, letters, and digits. The upper-
case commands define a word as a contiguous sequence of
nonwhitespace characters.
